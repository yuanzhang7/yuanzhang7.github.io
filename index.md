<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">YUAN ZHANG</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn), Nanjing. I am now supervised by [Prof. Guanyu Yang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2023/1024/c23024a469548/page.htm) for doctoral studies. Prior to this, I achieved master's degree at Imperial College London supervised by [Dr Andrew Scott](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.scott07) and bachelor's degree at Northwestern Polytechinical University. 

My research lies at the intersection of **Deep Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence in Medicine** -- with a special focus on dealing with the tough task in histopathology image. My research interests include **medical imaging**, **weakly-supervised learning**, **federated learning**, **foundation model**, and **multiple modality fusion**, etc.
